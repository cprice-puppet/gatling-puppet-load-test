Chris TODO:

* request_N.txt files do not exist
* Document the config file format
* get rid of some of the useless log output
* Maybe rename SimulationWithScenario?  Maybe make it a trait?
* Separate node simulation classes from framework classes
* Figure out a pattern for generating variable node names (feeders?)
