# long-running-mem-test

This directory contains a first pass at beaker scripts and JJB files for pipeline that will eventually automate running long running memory tests for PE/Puppet Server

It's very much a work in progress right now. This code is being moved here so that it's more visible, but its location/format/everything will probably change.
